1.   Opens and reads a text file named sample.txt.
2.   Prints its content line by line.
SOLUTION: 
--sample.txt file
this is sample text file
it contains multiple lines
--pythonfile
file1=open('sample.txt','r')
reading_file = file1.read()
print(reading_file)
--output
this is sample text file
it contains multiple lines

Process finished with exit code 0

TASK 2:  Write a Python program that:
1.   Takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt.
2.   Appends additional data to the same file.
3.   Reads and displays the final content of the file.
SOLUTION: 
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    data = input("Enter some text to write to the file: ")
    file.write(data + "\n")

    with open('output.txt', 'a') as file:
        data1 = input("Enter some text to write to the file: ")
        file.write(data1)

with open("output.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print("\nFinal content of output.txt:\n")
    print(content)
